# Assetlib wrapper for the gdlogging Godot addon

This repository is just a wrapper for the assetlib.
The main repository is [gdlogging](https://github.com/raldone01/godot_addon_gdlogging).

The assetlib does not support proper version control.
I recommend you to install this addon as a git submodule instead.
